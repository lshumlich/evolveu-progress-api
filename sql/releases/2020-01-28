This release is about adding a cohort grouping to the user table
so we can report by cohort seperatly. I haven't fully determine the
best way to update the attribute, we'll figure that out later.

SQL Commands

ALTER TABLE users ADD cohort varchar(10);

update users set cohort = 'FSD3' where cohort is null;
